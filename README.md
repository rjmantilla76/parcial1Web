## About

This is a very small page that lets you see who someone is following.
The page collects the data overtime in hopes that it will take longer for us to reach the Github API limit. (and it's a great excuse to use MongoDB)

I'm currently working on several projects that use TDA to understand networks and other kinds of data.
This app recolects some knowledge of the Github follower graph (from your queries!) and anonymizes it, providing it to you so you can run all kinds of crazy scripts on it.
